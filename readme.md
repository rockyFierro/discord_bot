# Botkit Discord Starter App
[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/glitchdotcom/starter-discord)

Starter Botkit Discord is a Discord bot with an interactive setup and coding guide. Click "Show" to start following the guide. We recommend following the guide before you go through the code here. 

The Install guide connects your Glitch app to a Discord app. It also teaches some important basic security guide. The Setup guide shows you how to add it to a Discord Server, keep it up and running, and add new functionality.

It uses

- Botkit: a handy bot building framework
- Discord.js: a node module for connecting to the Discord API
- Botkit Discord: A connector that allows you to use Bokit and Discord.js
- Uptime Robot: A monitoring service that helps keep your bot running 24/7

### .env

### .gitignore

Git is a "version control" system, which is a fancy way of saying it backs up a record of all your code. This file tells git not to back up certain files. For example `.env` we don't want it backing up because it contains secure info.

## guides.js

This contains the code that makes the guides accessible and interactive

### package.json

This is a file that contains info about your project, like what [node modules it should install](https://glitch.com/help/how-do-i-add-an-npm-module-package-to-my-project/)

## readme.md

This is this file! It's full of helpful info.

## server.js

This contains the code that connects all the different pieces of the bot together so it can be started by package.json
